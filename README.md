# Malware 
 
## What is this repository? 
 
Welcome! This repository was created to store all the code I am writing to learn how to write malware. My goal is to learn and reinforce my C, C++ and assembly coding skills through this process. Learning can be fun, and what better way to learn than by having fun with it?
 
## Disclaimer 
 
As you can probably tell, in this repository you will find some code that could be used for malicious purposes. Therefore, as a disclaimer, **all the codes stored in this repository ARE SOLELY MEANT for educational purposes. I don't, and will NEVER encourage using these codes for malicious purposes**. Feel free to download the codes and learn how they work, but do not use them for malicious things, as **I won't be responsible for ANY your actions. You have been warned.**
 
## Credits 
 
I am following a Malware-development series, and I would like to give credit to **Cr0w**. Without him, I wouldn't have created this repository, as I never would have learnt the basics of maldev.
